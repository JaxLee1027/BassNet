# BassNet
BassNet is an exploratory deep learning project designed to tackle a unique acoustic challenge: Can we reconstruct the missing low-frequency portion of an audio signal using only its high-frequency components?

V0: Conduct initial experience using Real-Acoustic-Field dataset. The first experience involved only RIR .wav files as dataset, we expected to introduce more dimensions to reinforce the prediction.
